C++ Heater Control Program

Description
This C++ program simulates a simple heater control system. It allows the user to adjust the temperature of a heater.

Features
-   Defines a `Heater` class to manage temperature.
-   Allows the user to increase or decrease the temperature.
-   Displays the current temperature.
-   Provides basic input validation for temperature limits.

Code Structure
The code consists of the following files:
-   `header.h`: Contains the declaration of the `Heater` class.
-   `Heat Controller.cpp`: Contains the implementation of the `Heater` class methods.
-   `main.cpp`: Contains the main function that uses the `Heater` class to create a Heater object and interact with the user.

Dependencies
-   iostream: For input/output operations.
-   string: For using string data type.

Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the program, save the files with their respective .cpp and .h extensions (e.g., header.h, Heat Controller.cpp, main.cpp) and use a C++ compiler.
